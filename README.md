# Code Assessment Turkey

## Assessment Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness of the program: Does it generate the correct Fibonacci sequence for the given
input number?
- Code quality: Is the code well-structured, modular, and readable?
- Input validation: Does the program handle invalid user input appropriately?
- Error handling: Does the program gracefully handle errors and display meaningful error
messages?
- Optimization: Does the program implement any optimization techniques to efficiently generate
the Fibonacci sequence?

# TASK ONE 
### Write a Java program that generates a Fibonacci sequence. The program should ask the user for an input number and then print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
